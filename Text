"Dear Alex, I utilized the Unity3D SDK from the Engage GitHub Repository to construct the Asset bundle. I followed the steps outlined below, but I'm unable to locate any output file in the AssetBundles folder within my SCE_Engage_Repo\Engage_External_Client_SCE\AssetBundles directory."
"I attempted this process using an existing VR project, utilizing a 3D FBX model and the sample scene provided in the Engage SDK."
"Kindly find attached the screenshot of my scene and the log file from the Unity3D build for your reference."
