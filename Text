"Dear Alex, I utilized the Unity3D SDK from the Engage GitHub Repository to construct the Asset bundle. I followed the steps outlined below, but I'm unable to locate any output file in the AssetBundles folder within my SCE_Engage_Repo\Engage_External_Client_SCE\AssetBundles directory."
"I attempted this process using an existing VR project, utilizing a 3D FBX model and the sample scene provided in the Engage SDK."
"Kindly find attached the screenshot of my scene and the log file from the Unity3D build for your reference."
"Hello Mangesh,

Following our last meeting regarding our readiness for the customer meeting, we have completed the following actions: prepared a cost proposal, created a VR demo video captured from our SCE VR application, and finalized a VR application video showcasing our Devita Dialysis Machine setup for multiplayer use.

Additionally, there are two more requests from the customer that we require assistance from the Immerse team. During our recent conversation with Jonathan, I inquired about obtaining a demo or demo video of the Immerse platform, as well as a SuccessFactor report. Jonathan mentioned that he would reach out to Brain for further details and updates.

Best regards,"
The scope of VR applications for medical device training is quite broad and offers several benefits:

1. **Realistic Simulation**: VR can simulate various medical scenarios and procedures with a high level of realism, allowing medical professionals to practice in a safe and controlled environment. This includes surgical procedures, device implantation, diagnostic techniques, and patient interactions.

2. **Hands-On Learning**: VR applications can provide hands-on experience with medical devices, allowing users to interact with virtual representations of equipment in a realistic manner. This can improve familiarity and proficiency with complex devices before using them in clinical settings.

3. **Customization and Adaptability**: VR training programs can be customized to the specific needs and skill levels of users, offering different levels of difficulty and complexity. They can also be updated easily to reflect changes in technology or medical protocols.

4. **Remote Training**: VR enables remote training opportunities, allowing medical professionals to access training modules from anywhere with an internet connection. This is particularly useful for healthcare professionals in remote or underserved areas who may not have access to traditional training resources.

5. **Feedback and Assessment**: VR applications can provide immediate feedback and assessment of performance, allowing users to track their progress and identify areas for improvement. This can enhance the effectiveness of training programs and accelerate skill development.

6. **Cost Savings**: VR training can reduce the need for expensive equipment and facilities, as well as the associated risks of practicing on live patients or cadavers. This can result in cost savings for healthcare institutions while improving the quality of training.

Overall, VR applications for medical device training offer a versatile and effective solution for educating healthcare professionals, improving patient safety, and advancing medical technology. As VR technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see further innovation and integration of these applications into medical education and training programs.
