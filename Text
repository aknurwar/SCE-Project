Dear Nathan,

I am currently undergoing mandatory classroom training this week and the previous week.

Regarding the 3D model and Engage file, I will request Saurav to assist in providing and sharing the assets for your reference.

As for your second request, I need to clarify whether you require the VR application (APK) file or the Unity3D project package file (source code). Kindly confirm. Please note that both files have relatively large sizes, so I will be able to share them once I return to the office on March 7th.
