Dear Nathan,
Last week and current week I am in Mandatory classroom training.
Regarding 3D model and Engage file I will asked to Saurav to facilitate and share the asset for your reference.
Regarding second request I want to ask you need VR application (APK) file or need Unity3d project package file (source code). Please confirm. In both the cases file size is relatively large so I am able to share it once I join office on 7th March.
