"Dear Alex, I utilized the Unity3D SDK from the Engage GitHub Repository to construct the Asset bundle. I followed the steps outlined below, but I'm unable to locate any output file in the AssetBundles folder within my SCE_Engage_Repo\Engage_External_Client_SCE\AssetBundles directory."
"I attempted this process using an existing VR project, utilizing a 3D FBX model and the sample scene provided in the Engage SDK."
"Kindly find attached the screenshot of my scene and the log file from the Unity3D build for your reference."
"Hello Mangesh,

Following our last meeting regarding our readiness for the customer meeting, we have completed the following actions: prepared a cost proposal, created a VR demo video captured from our SCE VR application, and finalized a VR application video showcasing our Devita Dialysis Machine setup for multiplayer use.

Additionally, there are two more requests from the customer that we require assistance from the Immerse team. During our recent conversation with Jonathan, I inquired about obtaining a demo or demo video of the Immerse platform, as well as a SuccessFactor report. Jonathan mentioned that he would reach out to Brain for further details and updates.

Best regards,"
