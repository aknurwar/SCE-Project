Subject: Request for Pro Access to Cognitive3D Platform

Dear Phil,

I am Chandrakant from the Swarup Mitra team, currently working on XR technology in the capacity of a Solutions Architect. Thank you for providing the technical overview and capabilities of Cognitive3D during Monday's team call. As discussed during the call, I have registered myself with Cognitive3D and have tried out the sample.

Could you please grant us Pro access so that we can explore the platform further and attempt to port our existing samples with Cognitive3D?

Thank you for your assistance.

Warm regards,
Chandrakant
