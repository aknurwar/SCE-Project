Dear Participant,
You have been through a workshop experience in the last 5 days. This experience was meant to initiate a journey of reflection and learning as well as help you take first steps in experimenting, consolidating learning and enabling growth and performance. It is likely that the workshop design and delivery may have achieved these objectives to differing extents. Please do take a few moments to review your experience, and share with us, your feedback.
Thank you!
