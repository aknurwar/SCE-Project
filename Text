We utilize both virtual reality and augmented reality technologies to create an immersive experience for one of the largest oil and gas exploration companies. They have developed an ROV-like device called the AD Spicerack and want to showcase its functionality and appearance. Traditional audiovisual presentations have proven challenging for marketing teams to effectively convey its features. Hence, we've developed VR and AR solutions compatible with HTC, Oculus, and Microsoft HoloLens. These tools empower marketing personnel and delegates to immerse themselves in firsthand experiences, leading to positive business outcomes.
